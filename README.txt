## Running Code
- There should be a folder called humvgpt containing files gpt.txt and hum.txt in the same directory as n_gram_classifier.py.
- numpy should be installed.
- python n_gram_classifier.py will run the ngram classifier, output accuracies and oov rates, and generate a set of random sentences with varying temperatures across human and gpt corpora.
